# Language Models and Transformer Architecture

Welcome to the Language Models and Transformer Architecture project! This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of a Transformer model, designed for natural language processing tasks. Our goal is to provide a robust and flexible foundation for experimenting with and building upon the Transformer architecture, making it accessible to researchers, developers, and enthusiasts alike.

## Description

This project implements a Transformer-based language model using TensorFlow and the Keras API. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need", revolutionized the field of natural language processing by introducing an architecture that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, abandoning the need for recurrent layers. 

Our implementation focuses on the core components of the Transformer, including multi-head attention, position encoding, and feed-forward networks, offering a concise yet comprehensive example of how to build such a model from scratch.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have TensorFlow installed in your environment. 

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies effectively. 

Follow these steps to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sorena-Dev/Language-Models-and-Transformer-Architecture.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd Language-Models-and-Transformer-Architecture

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

# Install TensorFlow
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the provided script to test the language model. 

The script demonstrates how to instantiate the model, define hyperparameters, and run a simple forward pass with sample input. 

## Features

- **Transformer Architecture**: Implements the core components of the Transformer model, including multi-head attention, positional encoding, and feed-forward networks.
- **Configurable**: Easy to adjust hyperparameters to experiment with different model configurations.
- **TensorFlow and Keras API**: Utilizes TensorFlow 2.x and the Keras functional API for a clean and efficient implementation.
